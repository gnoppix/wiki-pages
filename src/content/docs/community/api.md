The URL for OpenAI-compatible AI API calls is:

#### https://us.api.gnoppix.org

This is a centralized entry point with servers load-balanced across the entire planet. You can try to 'ping' the host, which should provide minimal latency.

As a Gnoppix Member, you can log in to see your daily contingent of 1000 free API calls and 20 requests per minute, or just check your remaining credits. Remember, this is a shared usage with all members; it is not intended to run a production system with your member key. It is more or less intended to test different models.

I'm using AI as well; my average 'costs' are around $2 per month.
