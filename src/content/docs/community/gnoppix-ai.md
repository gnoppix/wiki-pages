#### Install Gnoppix AI packages Core/PRO

In Gnoppix 24.6.1, I've begun separating the AI component from the main distribution. This is because the AI uses a significant amount of resources and additional memory. Gnoppix is typically able to run on very low-resource systems with only 600-800MB of RAM. This separation step was necessary to ensure continued support for older hardware.

 

To run AI effectively, a modern, high-speed CPU and/or GPU is required. Nvidia GPUs are generally preferred (no offense to AMD, but I haven't got from you any GPUs for AI tasks testing) In order to run the Gnoppix AI Suite you need the following Hardware specs: 

 
:::note
4 Core CPU 2+GHz

8 GB RAM 

min. 30GB free space on a SSD 
:::
 

You don't necessarily need a GPU. CPUs can handle all AI tasks. However, performance will be much slower compared to a dedicated GPU.

 

FYI, after installing the AI packages, NO DATA will be shared or transferred to anyone. Everything runs completely locally; you don't even need an internet connection. Safe and Secure!     

 

To install the main/base AI module, you need the following package:

* gnoppix-ai   (meta base packages) includes (35GB) 

* gnoppix-ollama (AI API) ~2GB 

* gnoppix-llm  (Our uncensored LLMâ€™s) ~31GB 

* gnoppix-gpt (GPT2 main webui) ~2GB

 

You can install the packages by your GUI or run **sudo apt install gnoppix-ai**  be aware you DL ~30GB over internet this can take some time and all depends on your internet connection.
