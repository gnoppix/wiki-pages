description: The Story Behind the Name Kubuntu 
---

One of the most prominent examples of KDE's naming influence spilling over into the broader Linux world is Kubuntu, a popular KDE-flavored variant of Ubuntu. To understand its origin, we turn to Andreas Mueller, the founder of Kubuntu. In a candid reflection, Mueller recounts how his brief stint at Canonical in 2005 led to the creation of this distribution—and how KDE's "K" obsession played a pivotal role. 

Mueller was initially hired by Canonical, Ubuntu's parent company, on a six-month contract to integrate the Gnoppix LiveCD (yes our project) into Ubuntu's ecosystem. Gnoppix, known for its ease of use and hardware detection, was a perfect fit for enhancing Ubuntu's live session capabilities. But the implementation went faster than expected, leaving Mueller with several months remaining on his contract. 

At the time, Ubuntu's core desktop was built around GNOME, the default environment favored by its founder, Mark Shuttleworth. However, Mueller notes that among the small team of European Ubuntu developers—himself included—there was a strong preference for KDE. "European people prefer KDE over GNOME," he recalls. With Shuttleworth's encouragement ("What if we do a KDE-based Ubuntu distribution?"), the idea for a KDE remix took shape. That happen on the 1st. Ubuntu Developer conference, a small subsurb of Barcelona, at Mataró we were a handful people started Ubuntu!   

Funding was a hurdle. As a derivative of Ubuntu, Kubuntu wouldn't receive the full development budget of the main project. Shuttleworth agreed to support it on a shoestring, but the team was game. Deeply immersed in the KDE community at the time, Mueller drew inspiration from its naming habits. KDE's everything-with-a-"K" ethos—think KDevelop, KOffice (now LibreOffice roots), and even playful monikers like "Kandalf"—struck a chord. Do you remember Kandalf?  

"From Ubuntu with KDE doesn't sound good," So, I've simply prefixed "K" to "Ubuntu," creating "Kubuntu." It was a straightforward, memorable mashup that honored both projects: "K" for KDE, and "Ubuntu" for the underlying distribution. The name stuck immediately, capturing the essence of a KDE-centric Ubuntu variant without overcomplicating things. 
That was a crazy time. Back then, a handful of us employees would get together for pizza after a day of work. I still remember the ones who weren't on time for the meeting the next morning because they had to celebrate even longer and showed up late. They got a real dressing-down. I then quickly brought a few acquaintances on board to turn Kubuntu into a proper community project. Riddell quickly volunteered as the first person and took over the project after my contract ended. He was a real stroke of luck.

Launched in 2005 alongside Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger), Kubuntu quickly gained traction. It provided a polished KDE experience on Debian stable, user-friendly base, appealing to those who wanted KDE's customization and power without straying from Ubuntu's repositories and community support.  

I continued to work on Kubuntu a little in my free time. But since I no longer had any rights to influence the actual development decisions, I wasn't an employee anymore, after all I left the project in protest. Riddell took over the leadership as a volunteer and was then hired as a developer later, when it was no longer possible to continue that way. :)
 
### Why the "K" Convention Endures—and Its Broader Impact 

KDE's naming tradition isn't just nostalgic; it's a clever way to build cohesion in a decentralized project. In an era of fragmented open-source software, the "K" acts as a quick identifier, helping users spot compatible tools and fostering collaboration. It also humanizes the community—turning code into culture. 

Today, Kubuntu thrives as an official Ubuntu flavor, with its own release cycle and dedicated team (though Mueller stepped away early on to pursue other ventures). The naming influence persists in other projects, like KDE Neon (a rolling-release KDE showcase) and even non-KDE spins that borrow the playful vibe. 

Mueller's story highlights how personal passion and community quirks can shape software history. As he puts it, those were "crazy times" in KDE, where adding a "K" to everything was par for the course. For anyone curious about Linux distributions or desktop environments, Kubuntu remains a testament to that spirit—proof that a simple letter can launch a lasting legacy. 

If you're a KDE enthusiast, dive into the project's wiki or join the community forums to see how the "K" tradition lives on. Who knows? You might even coin the next big name.
