#### About CoPilot 

CoPilot is a cutting-edge, open-source AI chat platform designed for ultimate privacy and user control, especially for those who prioritize anonymity and don't possess high-end local computing power. It functions by securely routing your AI queries through your chosen LLM provider's API, minimizing local resource demands.

A core tenet of CoPilot is its privacy-by-design philosophy: there are no monthly fees, we do not use your email nor give it way, ensuring maximum anonymity from the outset. Crucially, all our services are strictly not logged, providing an unparalleled level of privacy for your interactions. The system is "conceived" with this zero-logging policy at its core.

CoPilot supports a wide range of AI models. You have the flexibility to add your own API keys (incl. your own Gnoppix AI key) for providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. Alternatively, you can leverage the Gnoppix API, which further solidifies our commitment to privacy. In all cases, only you can use your keys, guaranteeing no unauthorized access. For enhanced security, we've also implemented a time limit where your key is valid, reducing the risk of compromised keys being used indefinitely. A vital note: be always aware that if you exploit or abuse the system, your key will be invalidated immediately. Please refer to our TOS for AI LLM for more detailed policies. More information, including specifics on Gnoppix AI models and pricing, can be found at https://wiki.gnoppix.org/features/ai-models-price/. CoPilot empowers you with secure, private, and flexible AI conversations without compromise.
