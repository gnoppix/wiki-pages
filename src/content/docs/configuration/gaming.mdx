Welcome to the guide for Gaming in Gnoppix. We'll guide you through the essentials aspects on how to setup everything and have a great experience.

## Prerequisites

:::caution
Before we dive into the fun stuff, it’s essential to ensure that your graphics card drivers are installed and functioning correctly. If your graphics card isn’t performing optimally, you may encounter issues when playing games.
:::

### Essential Packages

To make things easier for you, we have grouped all the necessary packages for gaming into one meta package that includes all the known stores and extras for gaming in Linux. This makes the installation and setup process for gaming faster and less convoluted for everyone.

```sh title='Run the following command in a terminal'
sudo pacman -S arch-gaming-meta

apt install gnoppix-gaming

```

:::note
The `gaming-meta` package installs all the important libraries, packages, plugins and stores such as Steam, Lutris and some tools which are necessary for most games to run and work properly. Check out the [package list](https://aur.archlinux.org/arch-gaming-meta.git) for more information on what is installing.

*If you find that any packages are missing, feel free to let the Gnoppix team know.*

## Steam

For Steam users, playing games on Gnoppix is a breeze! Open Steam and follow the [Proton guide](/configuration/gaming#how-to-enable-proton-support-in-steam) and you're ready to enjoy your games.

:::note
Laptop users with discrete NVIDIA GPUs should refer to the following [guide](https://wiki.gnoppix.org/configuration/dual_gpu/)

:::tip
Gnoppix provides various Proton versions that we build & maintain for further performance improvements:
- `proton` `(included in the gaming-meta package)` being the one that we develop with added QoL changes + cherry picked patches + compilation optimizations `(x86-64-v3 & x86-64-v4)`
- `proton-ge-custom`, `proton-tkg-git`, `proton-experimental` and `proton stable releases` are built against native libs.
- `proton-ge-custom-bin` pulled from AUR.

## Steam FAQ & Tips

### Which Proton version should i use in Steam?

- [`proton`](https://github.com/gnoppix/proton-gnoppix) Being the one that we build and maintain is highly recommended unless it has an issue with the game you want to play. Should work in most cases.
- `Proton Experimental` Bleeding edge release from `Valve` If the game you want to play is relatively new or it doesn't work well with the current Proton stable release or perhaps you saw people recommending it in [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/).
- `Proton 9.0.3 or lower` Stable releases from `Valve`. If the game you want to play only works in a previous Proton release.
- `Proton-GE` Build made by [GloriousEggroll](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) in some cases it comes in handy.

### How to properly set multiple launch options
The launch options in Steam are constructed using the following pattern
- `<env variables> <wrappers> %command% <application arguments>`
    - `<env variables>`: These are options in the form of `VARIABLE=value`. For example `PROTON_DXVK_D3D8=1` or `DXVK_HUD="fps,memory,version,api"`
    - `<wrappers>`: Applications and scripts that modify how the real application is run. Arguments to the wrapper usually go after the wrapper's executable. For example `mangohud --dlsym` or `gamescope -W 1680 -H 1050 -w 1280 -h 720 -S fit -F fsr --mangoapp --`
    - `%command%`: This is the real application. This should be specified exactly as is and Steam will replace it with the proper command when the application is run.
    - `<application arguments>`: These are various arguments to the real application, and they depend on the application. For example `-dx11` should go here if the application supports it.

- Example: `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP=1 prime-run game-performance %command% -dx11`

:::caution
Don't add multiple `%command%` by using them as separators for multiple launch options.

Example: `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP=1 %command% game-performance %command% prime-run %command%`
    - In this case, everything after the first `%command%` is going to be ignored because it's being treated as game arguments therefore only `__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP=1` got recognized as a launch option.
:::

### Fix stuttering caused by the Steam Game Recorder Feature

```sh title='Add the following launch option to your game'
LD_PRELOAD="" %command%
```

## Performance tips

### Power Profile Switching on Demand

:::note
This behavior is slightly different with `intel_pstate`. On Intel, the governor remains at powersave but the
EPP/EPB values are set to performance.
:::

Gnoppix provides a wrapper script [`game-performance`](https://github.com/gnoppix/Gnoppix-Settings/blob/master/usr/bin/game-performance)
which uses `power-profiles-daemon` to temporarily switch the current power profile to `performance`.
The `performance` profile increases the system power levels and changes the CPU governor to `performance`.

When this script is used to run a game, the system will be set to use the `performance` profile as long as the game is running.
The previously used power profile will be restored once the game is closed.

*[Feral's GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode)
has similar a behavior but it should not be used as Gnoppix already ships with [`ananicy-cpp`](https://gitlab.com/ananicy-cpp/ananicy-cpp)*

## Proton

Proton is based on Proton's `bleeding-edge` branch and applies a number of modifications on top of it.
- **Wine-staging patches**
- **Wine Fullscreen FSR**
- **Includes video and audio codecs for game cutscenes**
- **Support for `umu-launcher` including UMU-Protonfixes**
- **Adds early hotfixes/workarounds for games**

:::note
The `proton` package from the Gnoppix repositories is compiled against native system libraries, it doesn't use the Steam Linux Runtime. The target architecture depends on the repository. Currently `x86_64_v3`, `x86_64_v4` and `znver4` repositories use the same `x86_64_v3` binaries.
:::

:::caution
If you encounter issues with games using **Easy Anti-Cheat** (EAC) or **BattlEye** (BE), for example refusing to log in the game servers, you can use the version of [Proton-Gnoppix built using Steam Linux Runtime](https://github.com/Gnoppix/proton/releases)
:::

**Additional configuration options**

- `PROTON_NO_WM_DECORATION=1`: Disables window decorations using the Linux window manager. It can fix issues with **borderless fullscreen** and the mouse clicking through the window.
- `PROTON_PREFER_SDL_INPUT=1`: Enable to work-around issues with proper controller detection.


## Wine-Gnoppix

This is the same `wine` that is at the core of `proton-gnoppix`, but as a standalone package, which can be used in Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and others.

- **All the Wine modifications included with Proton**
- **Adds early hotfixes/workarounds for games**

:::note
In the repositories **Wine** is offered by two different packages. `wine-gnoppix` installs it as the default system Wine and replaces `wine` or `wine-staging`. `wine-gnoppix-opt` installs it in a different location, which allows multiple wine versions to co-exist in the system.
:::

:::caution
**Wine-Gnoppix's** primarily intended use is for **gaming**. Although it can be used as a system Wine with desktop applications, be aware that it might lead to some unexpected behavior and issues due to the gaming focused modifications.

If you want to use desktop application, we suggest using `wine` or `wine-staging` as your system's Wine and installing `wine-gnoppix-opt` for gaming.
:::

**Additional configuration options**

- `WINE_WMCLASS="<name>"`: Sets the `WM_CLASS` of all wine windows, allowing the window manager to control the Wine's windows through rules.
- `WINEUSERSANDBOX=1`: Disables the creation of symlinks from Wine user folders such as Documents/Pictures, to the equivalent folders in the user's `HOME` directory
- `WINE_NO_WM_DECORATION=1`: Disables window decorations using the Linux window manager. It can fix issues with **borderless fullscreen** and the mouse clicking through the window.
- `WINE_PREFER_SDL_INPUT=1`: Enable to work-around issues with proper controller detection.


### How to setup `wine-gnoppix-opt`
Normally running `/opt/wine-gnoppix/bin/wine` instead of just `wine` should be enough for an application to run using `wine-gnoppix-opt`.

If a more strict configuration is required, it could look like this
```shell
export PATH="/opt/wine-gnoppix/bin/:$PATH"
export WINEDLLPATH="/opt/wine-gnoppix/lib/wine:/opt/wine-gnoppix/lib32/wine:$WINEDLLPATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/wine-gnoppix/lib/:/opt/wine-gnoppix/lib32/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

If you want to use `winetricks` with `wine-gnoppix-opt` you can invoke it like this
```shell
WINE=/opt/wine-gnoppix/bin/wine WINEPRFIX=<your prefix> winetricks <verb>
```

## Bottles

Bottles is an application that allows you to easily manage Windows prefixes on your favorite Linux distributions.

Bottles can also make use of different runners like Lutris and are all manageable within the application. Bottles offers the option of a gaming-oriented prefix.

You can also install dependencies, add EXE files, and use their one-click installers for gaming-related apps like EA App or Battle.net.

```sh title="How to install Bottles"
# Open a terminal and run the following command:
sudo pacman -S bottles
```

*If you want to know more about it, check out their [documentation](https://docs.usebottles.com/).*

## Lutris Introduction & Tips

With Lutris, you can efficiently manage your game runners, including Wine, Proton, and emulators.

- **You can launch games through Lutris simply by clicking the `Play` button.**
- **Add any game you want clicking the `+` sign in the top left.**
- **Set up a store in the `Sources` at the left panel and connecting your account, it will then proceed to install said store, and then you'll be able to run games from within the store, just like you do on Windows.**
