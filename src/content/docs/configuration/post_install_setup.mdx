## Updating The System

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Using Octopi (GUI)">

Octopi is a graphical package manager for Arch-based distributions that provides a convenient way to manage packages and updates.
To update your system with Octopi, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Launch **Octopi** from the application menu.
2. In the main window, click on the **Check updates** button (Top left), now next to it **System upgrade.**
3. Octopi will now check for available updates and prompt you to either install them on Octopi itself or in a terminal.
4. To proceed with the update, click the **Apply** button.
5. Octopi will download and install the updates.
6. It is advised to reboot your computer after a big update **(especially if the kernel got an update)**.

</Steps>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Using Pacman">

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal emulator (or press **`ctrl + alt + t`** - **`mod + return`** in a WM e.G Qtile).
2. Run the following command to update the system:

   ```sh
   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```
3. It is advised to reboot your computer after a big update **(especially if the kernel got an update)**.

</Steps>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Offline System Update">

*CachyOS supports offline system upgrades using the [`pacman-offline`](https://github.com/eworm-de/pacman-offline) script. This allows your system to download package updates and apply them on the next reboot. (Yes like on Windows)*

:::note
The `pacman-offline` tool integrates with systemd's offline updates feature. It automatically handles kernel updates and module loading.

The `/etc/pacman.d/offline.conf` file is crucial for managing which packages are updated during regular and offline updates. Ensure it's configured correctly for your desired kernel or add the packages you want so they only get updated during the pacman-offline execution and get ignored in a regular update. Example: `pacman -Syu`.

**If you enable the automatic update timer, you no longer need to manually update your system.**
:::

<Steps>

1. **Install the pacman-offline package**

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S pacman-offline
   ```

2. **Telling Pacman to read from the separate package ignore list.**

   ```bash title='Add the following line to the /etc/pacman.conf file'
   Include = /etc/pacman.d/offline.conf
   ```
   *Example*
   ```bash
   # REPOSITORIES
   #   - can be defined here or included from another file
   #   - pacman will search repositories in the order defined here
   #   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
   #   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
   #     have identical names, regardless of version number
   #   - URLs will have $repo replaced by the name of the current repo
   #   - URLs will have $arch replaced by the name of the architecture
   #
   # Repository entries are of the format:
   #       [repo-name]
   #       Server = ServerName
   #       Include = IncludePath
   #
   # The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
   # uncommented to enable the repo.
   #

   Include = /etc/pacman.d/offline.conf
   ```
3. **Adding the CachyOS kernels in order to make pacman ignore them during regular updates**

   The `pacman-offline` tool uses this file to determine which packages to ignore during the traditional pacman updates.
   
   **Example: when you run `sudo pacman -Syu`**

   *Replace the contents of the `/etc/pacman.d/offline.conf` file with the following:*

   ```text 
   # Arch Linux kernels
   IgnorePkg = linux linux-headers linux-docs
   IgnorePkg = linux-lts linux-lts-headers linux-lts-docs
   IgnorePkg = linux-zen linux-zen-headers linux-zen-docs
   IgnorePkg = linux-hardened linux-hardened-headers linux-hardened-docs

   # CachyOS kernels
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos linux-cachyos-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-bmq linux-cachyos-bmq-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-bore linux-cachyos-bore-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-deckify linux-cachyos-deckify-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-eevdf linux-cachyos-eevdf-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-gcc linux-cachyos-gcc-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-hardened linux-cachyos-hardened-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-lts linux-cachyos-lts-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-rc linux-cachyos-rc-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-rt-bore linux-cachyos-rt-bore-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-sched-ext linux-cachyos-sched-ext-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-server linux-cachyos-server-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-lto linux-cachyos-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-bmq-lto linux-cachyos-bmq-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-bore-lto linux-cachyos-bore-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-deckify-lto linux-cachyos-deckify-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-eevdf-lto linux-cachyos-eevdf-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-gcc-lto linux-cachyos-gcc-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-hardened-lto linux-cachyos-hardened-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-lts-lto linux-cachyos-lts-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-rc-lto linux-cachyos-rc-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-rt-bore-lto linux-cachyos-rt-bore-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-sched-ext-lto linux-cachyos-sched-ext-lto-headers
   IgnorePkg = linux-cachyos-server-lto linux-cachyos-server-lto-headers
   ```

   *Now all of those packages are going to get ignored in the regular updates but checked during the offline preparation.*

3. **Start the preparation for the offline update only once**

   ```bash title='Run the following command'
   sudo systemctl start pacman-offline-prepare.service
   ```
   This command will then make pacman-offline to execute once and synchronize the package databases and proceed to download updates but doesn't install them.

</Steps>

*If you want this script to be automated. Follow the following steps:*

<Steps>

1. **Enable the preparation timer**

   The `pacman-offline-prepare.timer` being enabled will allow systemd to trigger this script to download updates in a daily basis after a few minutes of every system startup.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable pacman-offline-prepare.timer
   ```

2. **Reboot your system:**

   The updates will be installed during the next system reboot.

3. **(Optional) Automatic System Reboots:**

    Enable the `pacman-offline-reboot.timer` to automatically reboot your system by default at **3am** (Your timezone) if they're pending updates. Be aware that its not always at the same time schedule due to the inclusion of `RandomizedDelaySec` which is set to 2 hours by default.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable pacman-offline-reboot.timer
    ```

    :::tip
    You can edit the `pacman-offline-reboot.timer` file to either modify at what time you want your system to reboot if they're is any pending update or disable the randomized schedule.

## Configuring Firewall (ufw)
:::note
UFW is enabled by default after installation.
:::
To configure ufw, follow these steps:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Enable">

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Disable">

```bash
sudo ufw disable
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Allow">

By default, ufw allows all incoming and outgoing traffic, you can add specific rules to the firewall to block or allow specific connections.

```bash
# For example:
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Deny">

```bash
# To deny a specific port, check the following example:
sudo ufw deny 80
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Status">

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note
Be careful when configuring firewall rules, as improperly configured rules can lock you out of your own system.
:::

:::note
You can also configure it graphically using "Firewall" section in the KDE Plasma settings.
:::

## Enabling Global Menu
For some apps like Visual Studio Code, the global menu may not work or may be attached to the parent app instead of the panel.

```sh
# To enable global menu support, run the command and restart the app.
sudo pacman -S appmenu-gtk-module libdbusmenu-glib
```

## Enable AppArmor support using AppArmor.d profiles (Optional)

<Steps>

1. Add the following kernel parameters to your Boot Manager, see [Boot Manager Configuration](/configuration/boot_manager_configuration) for reference

   ```text
   lsm=landlock,lockdown,yama,integrity,apparmor,bpf
   ```

2. Install apparmor and apparmord **(Set of over +1500 profiles)** packages
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S apparmor apparmor.d-git
   ```

3. Enable/Start AppArmor service

   ```bash
   systemctl enable --now apparmor.service
   ```

4. Enable caching for AppArmor profiles

   ```shell
   # /etc/apparmor/parser.conf
   ## Add the following lines:
   write-cache
   Optimize=compress-fast
   ```
   Save the file and reboot.
</Steps>

## Changing the Default Shell

Currently, CachyOS uses [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as the user's default login shell. However, you can change
the default shell to whatever you like.

<Tabs>
   <TabItem label='bash'>

      This is the default shell on almost every Linux distribution. It is also still used as the root user's login shell. bash
      has basic autocomplete functionality and easy history management. It differs from zsh and fish in that it doesn't have
      the fancy customization and plugin ecosystem that both fish and zsh have.


      ```sh title='Changing your default shell to bash'
      ❯ chsh -s /usr/bin/bash
      ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label='zsh'>

      We provide a [zsh config](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachyos-zsh-config) with commonly used plugins and configurations.
      It aims to have 1:1 functionality with our [fish config](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachyos-fish-config).
      This is also the default shell used in MacOS.

      ```sh title='Changing the default shell to zsh'
      ❯ chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
      ```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Updating/using [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)

:::note
CachyOS uses [tealdeer](https://github.com/tealdeer-rs/tealdeer) which is a faster Rust based implementation of the original tldr 
:::

This tool is extremely useful for those who don't want to read much or waste time reading a help/man page.

<Steps>

1. ```sh title="Open a terminal and run the following command"
   tldr --update         
   ```
2. Example of using tldr:
   ```sh
   tldr java
     Execute a `.jar` program:

      java -jar filename.jar
   
   # As you can see, it's really useful and it new tools/pages get added over time
   ```

</Steps>
