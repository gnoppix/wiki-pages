## FAQ

### KDE keeps asking me for entering a password every time i open Discord, Brave or similar programs

**This is due to KWallet being enabled by default. You'll need to disable it in order to avoid entering the password.**
- What is the purpose of this "Wallet"?
  - **Quote from Arch Wiki:** *"A wallet (in the KDE's terminology, sometimes called vault or keyring) is an encrypted volume protected by a user-defined password where user and/or software can store secrets (often, credentials when the user checked "Remember the account" in an application)."*

Follow the steps from the [guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE_Wallet#Disable_KWallet) in the Arch Wiki in order to disable it.

Once you have followed the guide. **Reboot or log out from KDE Plasma.**

- **After disabling KWallet i had to relogin from all the services. Is that normal?**
  - Yes. That usually happens when you have already created a password for the KWallet. Just log in to your accounts again and the credentials will then be saved without the password prompt.

### How can i get the same look as the one shown in the KDE Screenshots? named as "Emerald"

- **It's a combination of the Emerald Theme + Qogir Icon Theme which they're not installed by default.**
  - ```sh title='Install both with the following command'
    sudo pacman -S emerald-kde-theme qogir-icon-theme
    ```
  **Apply both in `Appearance & Style - Colors & Themes`.**

### Why does SDDM looks so bland and old?

- *Since there is no SDDM theme being applied by default. SDDM will fallback to the classic theme.*
  - **Apply the Breeze Theme as shown in the screenshot**
