In the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence, access to powerful tools is becoming increasingly important. However, traditional monthly subscription models don't always fit everyone's needs. We've heard your feedback, and we're excited to introduce a usage method that caters to both the "hardcore office user" and your grandmother, along with a steadfast commitment to your privacy and ultimate convenience.

#### Pay for What You Use: A Smarter Way to Access AI

For too long, AI services have often been bundled into expensive monthly subscriptions, making them less accessible for those who don't need constant, heavy usage. Why should someone who occasionally uses AI for a quick query pay the same as a power user?

We're shifting to a credit-based system, designed for fairness and flexibility. Instead of a recurring monthly fee, you simply purchase credits as you need them. This means:

- Cost-Effectiveness for Light Users: If you only need AI for a few tasks a month, you're not locked into a high subscription. You only pay for the credits you consume.

- No Wasted Subscriptions: No more feeling like you're throwing money away on a subscription you barely use, a.e. if you on vacation.


Examples from Our Testing: We've tested this usage model over three months and found compelling results (**where 1 credit equals to USD$1):** 

- A typical university student used 20 credits within four months.

- A software developer used AI to support and document his work for three months.

- A freelance blog writer used 20 credits within three  months.

- My Partner used 20 credits within eight month.

- My sister still has 14 credits after seven months.

 

This model is more than fair, and we genuinely appreciate your support in making these flexible options possible. For our Gnoppix Members, we offer a quota of 20 requests per minute, and as a free benefit of your Gnoppix subscription, you share a daily pool of 1000 requests. If you find value in our service, you can easily purchase additional [credit packages](https://ko-fi.com/s/0101391aad) through our payment provider.

#### Your Privacy, Our Priority: Data Handling You Can Trust

In an age where data privacy is paramount, we understand your concerns about how your information is handled when using AI services. We believe that your prompts and responses should remain yours.

####  Here's how we ensure your data is safe:

No Default Logging: Gnoppix AI does not store your prompts or responses unless you have explicitly opted in to prompt logging in your account settings. It’s as simple as that.

- Metadata Only: We do store metadata (e.g., number of prompt and completion tokens, latency) for each request. This data is used solely to power our reporting, model ranking, and your activity feed.

- Provider Transparency and Control: We provide clear information on each AI endpoint about the data handling policies of our third-party providers. We work to ensure prompts are not used for training wherever possible. 

#### One Account for Everything: Streamlined Access

We believe in simplicity. That's why we're committed to providing a single account that gives you access to all our AI services. No more juggling multiple logins or subscriptions. Your Gnoppix account is your gateway to powerful AI tools, managed effortlessly.


### Privacy, Logging, and Data Collection

#### Ensuring Your Data is Safe

When using AI through Gnoppix AI, whether via the chat interface or the API, your prompts and responses go through multiple touchpoints. This page provides a practical overview of how your data is handled, stored, and used. More information is available in our [privacy policy](https://wiki.gnoppix.org/policy/privacy_policy/) and [terms of service](https://wiki.gnoppix.org/policy/terms_of_service/).

### Provider Policies

#### Training on Prompts

Each provider on Gnoppix AI has its own data handling policies. We reflect these policies in structured data for each AI endpoint we offer. On your account settings page, you can choose whether you would like to allow routing to providers that may train on your data (according to their own policies). There are separate settings for paid and free models. Wherever possible, Gnoppix AI works with providers to ensure that prompts will not be trained on, but there are exceptions. If you opt out of training in your account settings,Gnoppix AI will not route to providers that train. This setting has no bearing on Gnoppix AI’s own policies and what we do with your prompts.

#### Data Retention & Logging

Providers also have their own data retention policies, often for compliance reasons. Gnoppix does not have routing rules that change based on data retention policies of providers, but the retention policies as reflected in each provider’s terms are shown below. Any user of Gnoppix AI can ignore providers that don’t meet their own data retention requirements.

The full terms of service for each provider are linked from the provider’s page, and aggregated in the documentation.
