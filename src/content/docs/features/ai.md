#### Access All AI Models in One Place

:::info 
We are not forcing anyone to use AI. Gnoppix is a lightweight, fast, secure, and privacy-focused Linux desktop. The AI functionality is completely optional.
:::

That being said, you have the flexibility to transform your desktop into an Open Source AI-based desktop by running local, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). Alternatively, you can use your Linux desktop to access the latest closed models from providers like OpenAI and Google. The choice is entirely up to you.

A typical local AI installation can be hundreds of gigabytes, as the models run directly on your machine. By default, Gnoppix installs as a normal Linux desktop. If you decide to enhance it with open-source AI, you simply install the necessary AI core packages.

Copilot is an alternative to closed-source chat applications. It's designed for our members and is not a free, additional AI tool. To use it, you'll need a Gnoppix Member Subscription or your own API keys.

 
 

As the range of AI models expands, selecting the right one for your daily tasks can be overwhelming.

When I started with AI, I faced the problem of too many providers, each requiring a separate subscription. It cost me a small fortune. I had to enter my data everywhere, and transparency was minimal.

**"Which AI model should you use for your work?" Do you go with GPT-4.1 for blog optimization or Claude 4 Sonnet for affordable, seamless coding? Will you subscribe to both ChatGPT Plus and Claude AI Pro just to use those two models at the same time?**

The answer is **NO**. Why complicate things with multiple subscriptions when you can get access to all these powerful AI models in one place? Not just GPT-4.1 and Claude 4 Sonnet, but a whole suite of the latest and most advanced AI models such as Perplexity or Gemini Pro – all accessible through a single, unified platform.

Ready to explore how? Let's dive in!



**What are AI Models (LLMs)?**
------------------------------

AI models, specifically **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, are advanced artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language.

Using deep learning and transformer architectures, they can predict word sequences, answer questions, write content, and solve complex tasks.

Now, most popular LLMs have multimodal capabilities, meaning they can process and generate not just text but also other forms of input and output, such as images, audio, and video.

**Why Accessing Multiple AI Models**?
-------------------------------------

As these AI models performance and cost will vary, some are great for coding, while others excel at content creation. Having access to multiple models allows you to compare their outputs and cost to find the best one for your needs.

But there are some challenges with this:

*   **Higher cost**: use multiple AI models can quickly become expensive, as each platform requires its own subscription. For instance, if you want to use both ChatGPT and Claude, you’d be looking at around $40 per month – not exactly the most cost-efficient approach, right?
*   **Security and privacy concerns**: use different platforms may raise concerns about how your data is handled. Each provider may have different rules, making it harder to ensure your personal data stays safe.

**Those challenges can be easily resolved with Gnoppix AI – an all-in-one AI platform that allows you to access all AI models in one place** – with cost efficiency and better privacy protection!

**Why should you choose Gnoppix AI**
-------------------------------------

Here are some of the main advantages of using Gnoppix AI to access all AI models:

### 1\. Easily find the right models for your use cases

By accessing multiple AI models in one platform, you can easily compare outputs by switch back and forth between AI models.

This helps you identify the best model for your specific needs, whether you’re working on content generation, coding, or any other task.

More than that, you can fine-tune your workflow and choose the model that delivers the most accurate results at the optimal cost.

Switch AI models mid-conversation

### 2\. Optimize cost

No need to subscribe to the monthly cost from different AI Providers like ChatGPT Plus or Claude AI Pro. You are now using the AI models via API and only pay for what you use – which means you’re only charged based on the number of tokens (words or characters) processed by the model.

![](https://media.gnoppix.org/copilot5.png)


Use with your own API key


![](https://media.gnoppix.org/copilot6.png)


Define your own System Prompt

This is particularly beneficial for low-volume users who may not use AI regularly. Instead of paying for a subscription you might not fully utilize, the **pay-per-usage** model ensures you’re only charged when you engage with the models, which saves you money on idle time.
