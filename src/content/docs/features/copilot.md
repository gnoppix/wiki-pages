#### Gnoppix AI Copilot


The Gnoppix AI [Copilot](https://wiki.gnoppix.org/community/pilot) is a free public service offered by Gnoppix, a modern AI Linux Distribution with a strong focus on privacy and security. It is comparable to a GPT-like application. The difference to other GPT agents is that you can choose between almost all AI models, and you can build your own AI agent army on top. We have open-source AI models as well as the latest commercial ones, e.g., GPT-5 from OpenAI. The queries you submit are not used to train the models.

This is an easy way to use (uncensored) or the latest commercial AI at a very affordable price, all while utilizing a robust privacy stack that is difficult to find elsewhere on the internet, and trying different AI models with agents on one platform.


In order to use it, you can use BYOK (bring your own key) or use our free/paid Gnoppix Member API to test the current free LLMs with our advanced privacy features.

#### Local AI

**Typically, there are three ways to run AI on your computer, putting privacy issues aside:**

* You use a traditional GPT agent or API, typically costing $20-500 per month for a subscription.

* You use local AI, for example with Ollama, and use your own hardware. (included in Gnoppix Linux)

* You use our Gnoppix AI API key.

#### There are generally four ways to use Gnoppix Copilot GPT-like App:

* You can access the Gnoppix Copilot from any device with just a browser at: https://ai.gnoppix.org

* You can use Gnoppix Copilot directly from Gnoppix Linux.

* By buying credits, you get an API key that is 100% "OpenAI compatible," which you can use anywhere on any application asking for an API key and endpoint.

* You can use your own API keys (e.g., from Google).

:::note
Important Note: Gnoppix AI is a free service with a 1,000 queries-per-day limitation and 20 requests per minute. This is exclusively for our Gnoppix Members.
