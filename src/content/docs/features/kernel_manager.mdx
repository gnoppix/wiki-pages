title: Managing Linux Kernels & Sched-ext framework with the CachyOS Kernel Manager
description: The CachyOS Kernel Manager is a powerful tool for managing kernels, allowing users to easily install or build custom kernels with ease.

Installing a Kernel from a Repository
---------------------------------------

**The CachyOS Kernel Manager makes it simple to install and manage kernels from any Arch Linux repository.**

To install a kernel. Launch the `CachyOS Kernel Manager` application and choose the desired kernel by ticking the box `[]` from the list of all the available options then just press on `Execute` to start the kernel installation.

:::note
The `Execute` button becomes unavailable when you choose an already installed kernel.

Configuring and Building a custom CachyOS Kernel
---------------------------------

**The CachyOS Kernel Manager makes it easy to configure and build a custom CachyOS kernel.**

:::note
The CachyOS Kernel Manager is specifically designed to build custom kernels for **CachyOS variants** and does not support building or configuring a standard Arch Linux kernel or any other variant.
:::

*To get started. Open the Kernel Manager and click on the `Configure` button to start adjusting various settings, such as the desired scheduler, tick rate and more. Once you have made your desired changes click on `Build kernel` button to begin building your custom CachyOS kernel.*

**Available configuration options:**

* *`Custom package name`: **With this option, you can name your kernel to whatever you want example: `linux-custom-cachy`***
* *Scheduler (BORE, RC, RT, RT+BORE, EEVDF and BMQ)*
* *Enable CachyOS config*
* *Tweak Configuration via nconfig, menuconfig, xconfig, or gconfig*
* *Enable/Disable NUMA*
* *Enable/Disable Modprobed-db*
* *KBUILD CFLAGS (-O3 or -O2)*
* *Performance governor as default*
* *Enable BBR3*
* *Tick rate selection (100Hz, 250Hz, 300Hz, 500Hz, 600Hz, 750Hz, 1000Hz)*
* *Tickless mode (idle, periodic, full)*
* *Preemption (Full, Voluntary or Server)*
* *Transparent Hugepages (Always or Madvise)*
* *Enable/Disable DAMON*
* *Enable/Disable Automatic CPU arch detection*
* *Apply kernel optimization for specific CPU architectures*
* *Enable LTO (Full, Thin, No)*
* *Build ZFS Module*
* *Build NVIDIA Closed Module*
* *Build NVIDIA Open Module*
* *Include vmlinux with debug information/symbols*
* *Load/Save Kernel Manager config preset: `(Only presets from the manager itself)`*
* *Kernel Patches Management (Remote and Local support)*

**Once the kernel has been successfully built, you will be prompted for your sudo password to install the kernel.**

## Sched-ext Framework Management

**The Kernel Manager provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing and controlling sched-ext schedulers. Access the GUI by clicking on the `sched-ext scheduler config` button in the main window.**

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/cachyos-km3.png')} />

This GUI allows you to:

- **Switch between different sched-ext (scx) schedulers.**
- **Enable or disable the scheduler service.**
- **Check the currently running scheduler.**
- **Set scheduler flags and profiles.  `Currently only bpfland and lavd support profiles.`**

In order to achieve this, the Kernel Manager uses the `scx_loader` with a configuration stored in:

`/etc/scx_loader.toml`.  For more information about the `scx_loader` configuration file, check [this documentation](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/blob/main/rust/scx_loader/configuration.md).

- **How does the `scx_loader` work?**
    - Once you have selected the scheduler and profile, the scx_loader will then start the scheduler with the profile that has been selected and save this configuration to the `/etc/scx_loader.toml` file in order to achieve persistence across reboots. An example of what the file will look like choosing `scx_bpfland` with the `Gaming` profile:
        ```toml
        default_sched = "scx_bpfland"
        default_mode = "Gaming"

        [scheds.scx_bpfland]
        auto_mode = []
        gaming_mode = ["-m", "performance"]
        lowlatency_mode = ["-k", "-s", "5000", "-l", "5000"]
        powersave_mode = ["-m", "powersave"]
        ```

### Scheduler Profiles

- **What are the "profiles" for?**
  - They are presets for the scheduler that modify flags based on proven combinations to enhance effectiveness for specific use cases, such as "Gaming."

**Check the table for a more detailed look.**

#### Bpfland

|   Profile Name  	|  Command-line Flags  	|                                                         Description                                                         	|
|:---------------:	|:--------------------:	|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
| **Low Latency** 	| `-k -s 5000 -l 5000` 	| Meant to lower latency at the cost of throughput. Suitable for real-time applications like Audio Processing and Multimedia. 	|
| **Gaming**      	| `-m performance`  	| Optimizes for high performance in games. Prioritizes P-cores over E-cores on Intel CPUs and CCDs on Ryzen X3D CPUs.         	|
| **Power Save**  	| `-m powersave`       	| Prioritizes power efficiency. Favors less performant cores (e.g E-cores on Intel).                                          	|
| **Server**        | `-c 0`                | Disables the interactive task classification in Bpfland making more capable for a server, an increase of approximately 2-3% in server workloads is expected

#### LAVD

|       Profile Name       	| Command-line Flags 	|                                                             Description                                                            	|
|:------------------------:	|:------------------:	|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
| **Gaming & Low Latency** 	|   `--performance`  	| Maximizes performance by using all available cores, prioritizing physical cores.                                                   	|
|      **Power save**      	|    `--powersave`   	| Minimizes power consumption while maintaining reasonable performance. Prioritizes efficient cores and threads over physical cores. 	|
