#### Why Gnoppix Search: 

Enhanced Privacy: By avoiding user tracking and profiling, GS safeguards your online privacy and protects your search activity from being used for targeted advertising or other purposes.

Unbiased Results: The absence of user profiling ensures that search results are not skewed based on inferred user preferences, allowing for a more objective and unbiased search landscape.

Diverse Search Sources: By aggregating results from over 70 sources, GS offers a wider search net, potentially leading to more comprehensive and relevant results compared to single-source search engines.

Decentralization: It operates on a decentralized network, meaning there's no central point of failure. This makes it more resilient and less prone to outages compared to centralized search engines.

Scalability: The shard-based architecture allows the system to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the network without impacting performance or search accuracy.

Open-source: GS is open source, allowing developers from around the world to contribute to its development and improvement over time.

#### How it works: 

Gnoppix search is a decentralized search engine based on the concept of distributed data storage. It works by dividing an index into smaller, manageable chunks called 'shards.' These shards are then stored across different nodes in the network.

Each node in the network maintains a copy of its assigned shard(s) and is responsible for searching within that portion of the index. This approach allows for horizontal scaling, meaning more nodes can be added to the network without impacting performance or search accuracy.

Additionally, we utilizes a consensus algorithm to ensure all nodes agree on the current state of the index. This creates a robust and fault-tolerant system where no single node has complete control over the data.
