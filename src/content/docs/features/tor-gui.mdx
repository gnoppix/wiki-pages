## COMMANDS

* **`start`**
    Starts the Tor service and redirects all outgoing network traffic through the Tor network, enhancing anonymity.

* **`stop`**
    Stops the Tor service and reverts network traffic redirection, allowing all traffic to flow through the clearnet (unencrypted and untorified internet).

* **`status`**
    Displays the current status of the Tor service, indicating whether it is running and if traffic is being routed through Tor.

* **`restart`**
    Restarts the Tor service and reapplies the necessary traffic redirection rules. This can be useful for refreshing the Tor connection or resolving connectivity issues.

* **`autowipe`**
    Enables memory wiping at system shutdown. When enabled, the system will attempt to securely clear RAM contents during the shutdown process, helping to prevent sensitive data from being recovered.

* **`autostart`**
    Configures `gnoppixctl` to automatically start and apply its network rules at system boot. This ensures that Tor connectivity and traffic redirection are active from the moment the system starts.

* **`ip`**
    Retrieves and displays your current remote IP address as seen by external services. When Tor is active, this will show your Tor exit node's IP address.

* **`chngid`**
    Requests Tor to change its identity, which typically results in a new Tor exit node and a different IP address for your connection. This is useful for obtaining a new circuit and improving anonymity.

* **`chngmac`**
    Randomizes the MAC addresses of all active network interfaces on the system. This can help to prevent tracking based on hardware identifiers.

* **`rvmac`**
    Reverts the MAC addresses of all network interfaces to their original, permanent values. Use this command to undo changes made by `chngmac`.

* **`version`**
    Prints the version information of the `gnoppixctl` utility and then exits.
