## Downloading ISO

Gnoppix ISO can be obtained from the following sources:

*   [SourceForge](<https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnoppixng/files/>)
*   [Gnoppix Member Server](<https://patreon.gnoppix.com/iso/>) access require Gnoppix Member sub.
*   [Website](<https://pool.gnoppix.org/iso>) offline too less funds
*   [Gnoppix Beta Images](<https://beta.gnoppix.org/out/>) offline too less funds


:::note[INFO]
Gnoppix's default desktop environment is XFCE on Debian Linux. A public KDE version is planned for release in late 2026 / early 2027.
Our community's mission is to stay together, help, and learn from each other you don't need to be a coder. Every little, bug reports and idea helps us improve.

## Downloading PRO/ULTIMATE

PRO/ULTIMATE ISO can be obtained from the following sources:

*   [ULTIMATE 25](https:///ultimate.gnoppix.com/iso)
*   [PRO 23](https://cdimage.gnoppix.com/iso)


## Verifying ISO integrity with SHA256

:::caution[WARNING]
Always take an extra step to verify the ISOs integrity to avoid any undesired issues at installation or while creating a bootable media.
:::

**Current ISO Version:** `250204`

**SHA256 Hash:** `6b6562602705da3228d9862d7016a00ca6fa482482b87fd15656f9b2793f4ef6`

<Steps>

1. Download the [file](https://mirror.gnoppix.org/out/gnoppix-desktop-linux-241221.iso.sha256) containing the SHA256 hash **(Open it with a Text Editor e.g: Notepad).**
2. Open CMD or PowerShell as Administrator and [navigate](<https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt>) to the path where the ISO and SHA256 files are stored.
3. Execute the following command:
   ```powershell
   # Example:
   certUtil -hashfile gnoppix-desktop-linux-241221.iso SHA256
   ```
4. Compare the certUtil hash output to the one from the downloaded file in **Step 1.** If they match, you can proceed with the Gnoppix installation.

1. Download the [file](https://mirror.gnoppix.org/out/gnoppix-desktop-linux-241221.iso.sha256) containing the SHA256 hash.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `.sha256` file and execute the following commands:
   ```sh
   # Example:
   cd Downloads/
   cat gnoppix-desktop-linux-241221.iso.sha256
   # 6b6562602705da3228d9862d7016a00ca6fa482482b87fd15656f9b2793f4ef6
   ```
3. Compare the output from **Step 2** and execute the following command to check what's the current hash in the ISO file.
   ```sh
   # Example:
   sha256sum gnoppix-desktop-linux-241221.iso
   ```
4. If the hashes from **Step 2** and **Step 3** match, you can proceed with the Gnoppix installation.

## Verify ISO Image Authenticity (Linux)

To verify the authenticity of the ISO file to be sure that the actual one has been released by the official Gnoppix development team:

<Steps>

1. Import the GPG key for verifying the authenticity:

   ```shell
   gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key EA04DED48A72B3780909169E8F0C4802B19DD03E 
   ```

2. Download the ISO file and its `.sig` signature file and run the following command (by replacing `full_iso_name.iso` with the actual ISO filename):
   ```shell
   gpg --verify full_iso_name.iso.sig full_iso_name.iso
   ```

   If you get a **Good signature** output, the ISO file is genuine:
   ```
   pub   rsa4096 2024-11-10 [SC] [expires: 2034-11-08]
      EA04 DED4 8A72 B378 0909  169E 8F0C 4802 B19D D03E
   uid           [ultimate] Andreas Mueller <amu@gnoppix.com>
   sub   rsa4096 2024-11-10 [E] [expires: 2034-11-08]
   ```

</Steps>

:::danger
If the output does not return **Good signature** string or the key ID does not match, don't use the ISO image and make sure that the downloaded image comes
from a legitimate Gnoppix source. A bad signature could suggest that the downloaded image has been tampered with.
