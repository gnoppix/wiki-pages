title: Why Gnoppix Linux?
description: Why Gnoppix may be better for you

Gnoppix is an open-source project, not a company. We're a lifestyle where everyone's welcome to join and share ideas.

Gnoppix provides you with a secure, anti-forensic, and anonymous operating system. It includes all the features a privacy-conscious person needs.
Effortless Privacy & Security

Using Gnoppix is incredibly simple: just boot it from a USB drive on your PC. You'll have a fully running operating system with an established VPN connection, Tor connection, and DNScrypt service – all running automatically. No complex setup or prior Linux knowledge is required; it's secure by default.

The entire OS functions from your temporary RAM. Once you shut it down, no trace is left behind – all your activities are completely wiped.
Built on a Solid Foundation, Designed for the Future

Gnoppix was first publicly announced in June 2003.

It's primarily based on Debian, offering robust stability and long-term support, which is especially beneficial in business environments. Additionally, its core desktop is based on Arch Linux, allowing users to test software with the very latest kernel, which solves compatibility issues sometimes found with newer programs on older systems. Both come complete with a set of additional software repositories, providing the latest 64-bit versions of the newest desktop environments, frameworks, and toolkits.

Beyond the popular Gnoppix Desktop, we're also developing a Docker version of Gnoppix. Plus, we're actively working on a Gnoppix version for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.

You can use Gnoppix Linux in two ways: live boot from a DVD/USB for temporary, trace-free sessions, or install it on a desktop, laptop, or microdevice for a permanent setup.
