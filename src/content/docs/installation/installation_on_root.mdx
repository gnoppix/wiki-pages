title: How To Install Gnoppix & Partition Guide
description: Erase Disk Installation
---

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

:::caution
Secure boot must be disabled when installing Gnoppix. To setup secure boot after install. Check [Secure Boot Setup.](/configuration/secure_boot_setup)
:::

:::tip
It is highly recommended to restart the ISO after a failed installation attempt.

Otherwise, continuous errors can happen during the installation process.

This happens because the installer doesn't properly unmount partitions on a failed install.

:::

## Erase Disk

The "Erase Disk" Option in Calamares will wipe the selected disk and install Gnoppix to the target.

<Steps>

1. Boot into the ISO and click on **Launch Installer**.

2. Select the preferred **Boot Manager**. Check the [Boot Managers](/installation/boot_managers) section for more information.

3. Set the preferred **Language** and **Region/Timezone**.

4. Configure **Keyboard Layout**.

5. Select **Erase Disk** and choose a [Filesystem](/installation/filesystem).

6. Select the **Desktop Environment** of choice, see [Desktop Environments](/installation/desktop_environments).

7. Customize which packages should or should not be installed during the installation process.

8. Setup login credentials.

9. Review the installation summary on the Overview Page carefully. Proceed with the installation by clicking on ***Install Now*** if everything looks correct. Otherwise, go back and make any necessary changes.

</Steps>

## Dual Booting

*After manual partitioning, additional setup may be required to configure a dual boot system, especially with `systemd-boot` and `GRUB`.*

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label='systemd-boot'>
        *We need to copy the Windows EFI binaries to the Linux EFI partition so that the boot manager can recognize them.*

        <Steps>
        1. Locate the `Windows EFI partition` with `lsblk`

            ```sh title='Example'
            ❯ lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT
            NAME        FSTYPE   SIZE MOUNTPOINT
            zram0               15.3G [SWAP]
            nvme0n1            476.9G
            ├─nvme0n1p1 vfat     100M
            ├─nvme0n1p2           16M
            ├─nvme0n1p3 ntfs   234.4G
            ├─nvme0n1p4 ntfs     830M
            ├─nvme0n1p5 vfat       2G /boot
            └─nvme0n1p6 btrfs  239.6G /var/tmp
            ```

            *EFI partitions are almost always formatted as `FAT32/vfat`, and since nvme0n1p1 does not have a Linux mount point, assume that this partition is the `Windows EFI partition`.*

        2. Temporarily mount the `Windows EFI partition`.

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/WinBoot # Replace `nvme0n1p1` with the partition of Windows's EFI partition
            ```

        3. Copy the EFI binaries from the `Windows EFI partition` to the `Linux EFI partition`.

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo cp -r /mnt/WinBoot/EFI/* /boot/EFI
            ```

        4. Unmount the previously mounted partition, and Windows should appear in the boot menu on the next startup.

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo umount /mnt/WinBoot
            ```

        </Steps>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label='GRUB'>
        *GRUB uses os-prober to automatically detect the Windows EFI partition and add it to the boot menu.*

        <Steps>
        1. Install and execute `os-prober`

            ```sh
            ❯ sudo pacman -S os-prober
            ❯ sudo os-prober
            ```

        2. Enable `os-prober` in the GRUB configuration file

            ```sh title='Press CTRL+S to save and CTRL+Q to exit from Micro'
            ❯ sudo micro /etc/default/grub
            # /etc/default/grub
            # Probing for other operating systems is disabled for security reasons. Read
            # documentation on GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER, if still want to enable this
            # functionality install os-prober and uncomment to detect and include other
            # operating systems.
            GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false

            ❯ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
            ```

            **Windows should now be added to the boot menu.**
