## System Requirements

Before beginning with installation preparations, make sure that the computer used meets the necessary system requirements in order to run Gnoppix. The installer
uses an online installation process so a stable and relatively fast internet connection is mandatory.

<TabItem label="Minimum requirements">

*   3 GB RAM
*   30 GB of Storage Space (HDD/SSD)

### balenaEtcher

<Steps>

1. Download [balenaEtcher](<https://etcher.balena.io/>). balenaEtcher supports flashing an image of Linux, MacOS and Windows.
   If a `.zip` file was downloaded, extract it and execute the binary using the following commands:
      ```sh
      # Extract zip file:
      bsdtar xvf <zip file name>
      # cd to the new folder:
      cd balenaEtcher-linux-x64/
      # Execute balenaEtcher:
      ./balena-etcher
      ```
2. Plug in a USB drive to the computer.
3. Select **`Flash from file`** and select the Gnoppix ISO image file.
4. Click **`Select target`** and choose the USB drive that was previously plugged in.
5. Press **`Flash`** to start the flashing process.

### Command Line Interface (Linux & MacOS)

<Steps>

1. Plug in a USB drive.
2. Detect the plugged USB drive using the following commands:
   ```sh
   # Linux
   # The USB drive could be identified e.g: /dev/sda, by disk model and size.
   sudo fdisk -l

   # MacOS
   # USB drives are identified as "/dev/diskY" where "Y" could be 0,1 etc.
   diskutil list
   ```
3. Copy the iso contents to the plugged USB drive by running:
   ```sh
   # Replace <usbdrive> with the label of the drive.
   sudo dd bs=4M if=full_iso_name.iso of=/dev/<usbdrive> status=progress oflag=sync
   ```
</Steps>

- `dd` will now copy the contents of the ISO file over to the plugged USB drive.
