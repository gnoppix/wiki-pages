## Installation

### General Information

Gnoppix provides out of the box support for the T2 MacBook. The required kernel patches are shipped in all the kernels provided by Gnoppix.

**WiFi connection** is **not available** out of the box because it is a closed source firmware, which Gnoppix is not allowed to redistribute.
The installation will only work with a LAN connection. WiFi support can be set-up after the installation.
See [installation of the firmware](#installation-of-the-firmware)

### Proceeding with Installation

Follow the instructions in [Installation Prepare](/installation/installation_prepare#creating-a-bootable-gnoppix-usb-drive) on how to download
the ISO and create a bootable USB drive.

You need to follow additional steps to prepare a T2 MacBook for installing Linux such as partitioning your disk using macOS and disabling secure boot. You can follow the [t2linux Preinstall guide](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/preinstall/) for instructions.

Refer to [Installation on Root](/installation/installation_on_root) after creating a bootable USB drive.
Gnoppix applies necessary boot parameters and configurations to the user's T2 MacBook with [Gnoppix Hardware Detection](/features/chwd).

### Installation of the Firmware

The firmware can be downloaded and fetched from another mirror, which is not hosted by Gnoppix.

Run the following commands after booting into the installed system:

<Steps>

1. Fetch firmware package using one of the following utils:

    <Tabs>

    <TabItem label="using curl">

    ```sh
    curl https://mirror.funami.tech/arch-mact2/os/x86_64/apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst -o apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="using wget">

    ```sh
    wget https://mirror.funami.tech/arch-mact2/os/x86_64/apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```
    > If `wget` is unavailable, install it with `sudo pacman -S wget`

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. Install firmware package
    ```sh
    sudo pacman -U apple-bcm-firmware-14.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
    ```

</Steps>

After that modprobe the firmware and reload the wifi driver:
```bash
sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac_wcc
sudo modprobe -r brcmfmac
sudo modprobe brcmfmac
```

The firmware can also be extracted from an ISPW file, see the [t2linux wiki page](https://wiki.t2linux.org/guides/wifi-bluetooth/)
