AI Terms of Use for the Gnoppix Platform

#### 1. Acknowledgment and Assumption of Risk

By using the AI features of the Gnoppix platform, whether locally or via API, you ("User" or "You") acknowledge and agree that this is an experimental technology. The AI is uncensored, not moderated, and operates without filtering or content control by Gnoppix ("We," "Our," or "Us").

* Infringing: Outputs may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, including copyright and trademark.

* Biased or Discriminatory: The AI may reflect and amplify biases present in its training data, leading to discriminatory or prejudiced outputs.

#### 3. Distinction Between Local and API Usage

The Gnoppix platform provides two distinct methods for interacting with AI models, each with different responsibilities for the user.

#### 3.1. Local AI Models

When you use an AI model that runs locally on your device, the processing of your inputs and the generation of outputs occur entirely on your machine. You understand and agree that:

* We do not have access to, monitor, or control your inputs, outputs, or any data processed by the local AI.

* We do not store any prompts, queries, or generated content from your local use of the AI.

*Your use of the local AI is entirely your responsibility, and we disclaim all liability for content generated on your machine. You acknowledge that you are providing a tool to yourself and are solely responsible for your use of that tool.

#### 3.2. API and Remote AI Models

When you use the Gnoppix API or any other remote AI model, your data and prompts will be transmitted to and processed by a remote server, which may be operated by us or a third-party provider. You understand and agree that:

* Data transmission to a remote server may be subject to different privacy policies, terms of service, and content moderation rules from the remote provider.

* While we may implement technical safeguards, we are not responsible for the security of data transmitted over the internet to a third-party API.

* You are responsible for complying with the terms of service of any third-party AI provider whose services you access through our API. We are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices of any third-party AI.

#### 4. Intellectual Property and Content Ownership

* Your Content: You retain all intellectual property rights in any content you provide as input to the AI.

* AI-Generated Output: You acknowledge that the intellectual property status of AI-generated content is an evolving area of law. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any AI-generated content you use or distribute does not infringe upon any third party’s intellectual property rights. We make no claims or warranties regarding the copyrightability or ownership of AI-generated outputs.

#### 5. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Gnoppix, its affiliates, employees, and partners from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) that arise from:

* Your use of the AI, including any content you generate or distribute.

* Any violation by you of these Terms of Use or any applicable law.

* Any claims by third parties, including but not limited to claims of copyright infringement, defamation, or illegal activities, resulting from your use of the AI.

#### 6. Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GNOPPIX BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE AI. THE AI IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

#### 7. Disputes and Geographic Restrictions

These Terms provide that all disputes between you and Gnoppix will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract, except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury, and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of [Insert Name of a Reputable Arbitration Service, e.g., the American Arbitration Association]. The arbitration will take place in [City, State].

By using the AI features, you also warrant that you agree to the Gnoppix general Terms of Service and that you do not reside in any country that has laws, regulations, or policies that restrict the usage of open-source AI, uncensored LLMs, or similar technologies. You agree to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Gnoppix platform and its AI features is legal in your jurisdiction.
