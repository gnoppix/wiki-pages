## 2. Geographic and Residency Restrictions

[cite_start]This service is explicitly unavailable to residents of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), or the United Kingdom (UK)[cite: 11]. [cite_start]The service is not intended for the EU market, and any use by residents of these jurisdictions is a direct violation of this agreement[cite: 12].

### 2.1. User Declaration of Non-EU Residency

[cite_start]Before accessing the service, you must confirm that you are not a resident of the EU, EEA, or UK[cite: 13]. [cite_start]By clicking the checkbox below, you declare and warrant that you are not a resident of these jurisdictions[cite: 14].

[cite_start]☐ I am not a resident of the European Union, the European Economic Area, or the United Kingdom[cite: 15].

[cite_start]If you make a false declaration, your access will be terminated, and you will be in material breach of this agreement[cite: 16]. [cite_start]You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any damages, fines, or legal costs incurred as a result of your fraudulent representation[cite: 17].

### 3.1. Donations and Refunds

[cite_start]To qualify for a student or discounted membership, you must provide valid documentation as specified on our website[cite: 26].
