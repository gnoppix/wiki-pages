### Question 1: As a Gnoppix Member, can I access the Copilot and API?

Yes. Gnoppix Members can access our free Large Language Models (LLMs) through the Gnoppix AI portal at https://ai.gnoppix.org. You can log in to use the web interface or access the models via our API endpoint.

Gnoppix Linux is built on open-source principles. We have integrated applications to run on local AI (on your own machine), Gnoppix AI (our hosted service), or any other third-party provider. For maximum privacy, **we always recommend using local AI.**

- **I'm a member and have access:** Great! You can start using the Gnoppix AI portal, the upcoming mobile app, or integrate the API into your own applications using our endpoint documentation.

- **I'm a member but can't get access:** If you are a member but cannot access the Gnoppix AI portal or API, please request access through our service desk. Use the same email address that is associated with your Gnoppix Membership.

-Service Desk: https://gnoppix.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1

- **I'm not a member:** Non-members do not have free access to Gnoppix AI. To use the service, you will need to purchase tokens.

### Question 2: I have a PRO/Ultimate version of Gnoppix. Does this include access to Gnoppix-hosted LLMs?

**No**. Access to our hosted LLMs is a separate, paid service. It is designed for users who may not have a powerful GPU or who prefer not to use closed-source LLMs (like those from OpenAI) due to privacy concerns. Gnoppix Linux itself is built to run AI models on your local computer, using your own resources.

However, a Gnoppix Membership does grant you access to our free-tier AI and API.

For a complete overview of all our offerings, please visit Gnoppix Services: https://gnoppix.org/services/

### Question 3: I don't want to become a member. Can I still access Gnoppix AI?

The free services are exclusively for Gnoppix Members. However, non-members can still access the platform by purchasing tokens.

- Purchase Tokens: https://wiki.gnoppix.org/features/ai-token/

Purchased tokens grant you access to both the premium and the free models available on our platform.

### Question 4: I like the Copilot interface. Can I use it with my own API keys from other providers?

Yes, absolutely. Once you have access to the Gnoppix AI portal, you can add and use your own API keys from other providers. This functionality will also be available in the upcoming mobile app.

### Question 5: I only use AI occasionally. Do my credits expire?

Our platform is ideal for infrequent users because you only pay for what you use. However, to manage inactive accounts, any account with no login or usage activity for a full year will be automatically and permanently purged. This action is not recoverable.

### Question 6: I have tokens and API keys. What's next?

You can use your tokens with any of your applications that support API integration. If you don't have a local chatbot interface, you can use our Gnoppix AI portal at https://ai.gnoppix.org.

You can add API keys from other AI subscriptions you may have to use them all within the Gnoppix AI interface.

Once you have an account, you can use the interface forever, even if you only use your own API keys and never purchase Gnoppix credits.

Please remember the one-year inactivity policy mentioned above.

### Question 7: Are Gnoppix API costs competitive with other providers?

Yes, they are. Our goal is to make AI accessible, affordable, and trustworthy for everyone.

Philosophy: Our primary mission isn't to generate profit from the API itself. We prioritize your privacy with transparent data handling and provide the convenience of a single account for multiple models.

Pay-As-You-Go vs. Subscription: Many providers use a monthly subscription model (e.g., $20/month). Our research shows that average AI usage varies greatly from month to month. That's why we adopted a credit-based model. You only pay for what you use, and your credits can last for years, giving you the flexibility to test the latest models without being tied to a recurring subscription.

Usage Tracking: Our user interface provides a clear overview of your token and model usage, as well as your remaining credit balance.

**Partnerships:** We are always open to collaborations, especially regarding infrastructure. Please contact us if you are interested.

### Question 8: How do you handle my privacy?

Gnoppix does not share your personal data with API providers. They will not know who you are based on the requests we send. For more details, please review our Privacy Policy:

- Pivacy Policy: https://wiki.gnoppix.org/policy/privacy_policy/

### Question 9: What happens to my prompts?

We have special contracts with our API providers stipulating that, by default, they do not use customer prompts for training their models. This may differ for the "free" models offered by them.

While we take these contractual steps, we cannot ultimately guarantee what happens to your prompts on a third-party service. If your work is sensitive, we strongly recommend using the local AI models included with Gnoppix Linux. When using local AI, no data is ever sent over the network, and it can even be used without an internet connection.

### Question 10: I'm new to AI. Where can I get help?

We have a helpful community and multiple resources where you can find support:

- Discord: https://discord.gg/WUuT59Fdp9

- Forum: https://forum.gnoppix.org/

- Service Desk: https://gnoppix.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1

- Email: support@gnoppix.atlassian.net

### Question 11: Can I use Gnoppix AI in our office?

The Gnoppix AI is not designed for high commercial usage. Our AI Service is built for approximately 5,000 users. If you're interested in this type of service, please contact us.



### Question 12: I've purchased a membership or credits but haven't received my login information.

Our payment and support systems are handled by separate partners. Gnoppix operates as a community, relying on these external providers. Data processing between these systems can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 48 hours.

Typically, during our support partner's business hours (9:00 AM - 6:00 PM SGT, weekdays), processing is completed within a few minutes. If you do not receive your information after 48 hours, please contact us through one of the support channels listed above.
